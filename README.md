# Invaders go away facebook branch 

## notes on things we need to do
-single.php only requires the session User to be set to be happy
-If we set this in the login page then we can detach from the need for the user to be connected to facebook


*note: this project was put on hold for so long as a result of the problems with the facebook login it seems both long over due and some what too late to be trying to remove the requiremnent for intergration now.
